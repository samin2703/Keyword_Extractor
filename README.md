# Keyword_Extractor
This project is a Flask-based web app for keyword extraction using NLP techniques. Users can upload documents, and the app processes the text using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. It leverages TF-IDF to extract the most relevant keywords, providing a simple UI for keyword extraction and search functionality.
